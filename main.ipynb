    "## Abstract\n",
    "The following paper explores and analyzes the text of US State of the Union Addresses from 1790-Present. After some basic exploratory analysis of the metadata, we use NLTK to compute general text analysis metrics, create a term-document matrix for direct corpus analysis, present scatterplots of the speeches using Multi-dimensional scaling techniques to collapse the high dimensional data onto two dimensions, and then compute a variety of complexity metrics to investigate the changes in complexity to US State of the Union Addresses over time.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "A common criticism of modern American politics is that it has gotten dumbed down over time. The level of discourse of our modern politics is said to pale in comparison to the discourse of such intellectual giants of the past, from Thomas Jefferson to FDR. We sought to examine whether such criticisms are valid, or are merely the results of malcontents looking at the past with rose-tinted glasses. By evaluating State of the Union speech complexity using a variety of metrics, we found that the complexity of State of the Union speeches show a strong trend toward decreasing complexity over time.\n"

    "The graph shows that comparing to Clinton, Trump began the election campaign with lower supportive figures. On the top right of the graph, we can see some polls indicate that Clinton had 80%-85% of the votes, which is so contraditary to the actual election result. However, we could see the trends of percentage of votes changes as time goes by. At the begining of 2016, Clinton got much higher percentage polls and gradually decreased through the year untile November 2016(right before the election.) In contrast, Trump received more and more percentage of polls through out the year. This probably gave us a sign of sharply increasing actual voting percentage in the election at the end of 2016.\n",

Supprisingly, btoh grade-A+ and grade-A poll results indicate that Clinton has higher support rate than Trump. None of these indicates Trump has a higher rate than Clinton. Another surprise! On the boxplot of grade-B and grade-C, we see the data spread widely. The large range indicates that the public have a huge difference"

    "During part 3 of the project, we have loaded the data from part 2 and save the variables as speech_word and speeches_cleaned. In the first cell, we use for loop to go through the speeches_cleaned line-by-line to get all the unique words and set all unique words into a new variable called unique_word.  For the future use, we used sorted() function to make our unique_word variable contains the numbers of unique words for each president in order.  The results gave us 18797 unique words in total.  To create a function called word_vector(doc, vocab), we use two for loops to add each word and the number of it appears into one matrix.  For stem words in speeches_cleaned, we append the speech(number of the word appears) and the unique word into a vector and create a matrix.  Lastly, we transformed the matrix into data frame using pd.DataFrame and np.array functions, and take the transpose to make “words” as rows, and count as “columns”.  Now the wmat matrix contains the number of counts for each word in the entire document.\n",
    "For the last calculation part, we found out number of words that has 0 in wmat, and take the summation of number of zeros for each president and take summation again for each row.  This gave us the total number of zeros in the whole matrix, and divided by the total number of entries.  Total number of entries can be calculated as the number of rows multiple the number of columns.  Shape.[0] and shape.[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we got 93.15% zeros amount all the data, which indicated that a huge amount of words are not been said for different presidents.  President in each term had their own way of giving speeches, and it was not too common to see a lot of repeating in the words they said.  That is the reason more than 93% of the wmat entries are zeros."

We create a state directory which includes all the state names and their abbreviation.  Using for loop to go through every state in our dataset and sum all the poll votes for Trump and Clinton.  We use the command “(clinton/trump * samplesize).sum()” to calculate the percentage poll vote they received.  Then, use append to create a new datalist that contains each presidents’ voting percentage, state names, and the total sample size called df_diff.  We sorted the values in the results file to make the state in the alphabetic order, so that it will match with our df_diff dataframe.  To calculate the percentage change in the poll data with the actual voting result, we subtract two columns, since we sorted the value for our results dataframe data, it matches the order in df_diff.  \n",

As we could see in the graph, both presidents got really close voting percentage in the 13 swings state, especially if we look closer, states like Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Trump got only slightly more voting percentage than Clinton, and their votes are really close.  Only Nevada and Marina swing to Clinton as both states had really close voting percentage as well.  Except for those states that had really close percentage voting for those two presidents, only California, District of Columbia, skewed their votes to Clinton.  There are 29 states have the red dots higher than the blue ones, which indicates that those states are all giving their states votes to Trump.
